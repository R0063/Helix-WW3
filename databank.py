Q7. Function: 
	Points: 800
	Title: Secure their Network
	Content: Make them accept your explanation, by helping them with the Following problem:
	To cut costs, UN wished to power their network with their own special encryption. Each server would further 
	encrypt and send information to the server numbered next, with the top server sending data back down 
    to the bottom server. That way, they could have the information entered on any node and have data flow 
    freely throughout the network.

    Unfortunately, the designers misinterpreted the schematics when they built the network. It was leaked that 
    each server sends data to another server at random, instead. 
    This may compromise their freedom to have the data entering the network anywhere, since certain nodes may 
    never recieve the info and hence increase data loss risks.

    For example, consider the following connections in a 3 server based network with servers numbered 1,2 and 3 
    in order:
    1 connects to 3
    3 connects to 2
    and 2 connects to 3

    If the information was fed in the first node, then every server would receive data. But if it were fed in the 
    second or third servers instead, then there would be no data entering first server. Note that while a given 
    server can receive data from many other servers at once, it can only send data to one other server.

    To resolve the data loss risks, UN decided to have a minimal number of servers rewired. To rewire a server is 
    to change the server it sends data to. In the sample above, all possible losses can be avoided by rewiring 
    the second server to send data to the first server instead of the third server.

    Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of server rewirings needed over all possible data-flow arrangements
    in a network of n servers. For example, F(3) mod 135707531 = 6.
    Find F(8) mod 135707531.

Q13. Func: Iran Network Down
	Points:400
	Title:War of the wizards
	Content:You try to bring the iranian network down, paving the way for a complete strategic victory.
	Their binary nature of their network intertwines it's fate with the number 2, you must get to understand the root of 2 to destroy it.
	The square root of 2 can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction. sqrt(2) =  1 + (1 / (2 + 1 / (2 + 1 / (2 + 1.....
	Expanding this for the first three iterations:
	1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
	1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
	1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 17/12 = 1.4166...
	The eighth expansions is 1393/985, which is the first exxpansion where the number of digits in the numerator is mroe than that in the denominator.
	In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

Q14. Func: Ashen Victory
	Points:200
	Title: Forward, glorious death!
	Content:You believe in our troops and give them the chance to savour the ashen taste of victory.
	In the midst of battle, divine inspiration strike you and you realise that the secret to overflowing the enemy encirclements is held in Budget-Lychrel numbers.
	If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
	Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

	349 + 943 = 1292,
	1292 + 2921 = 4213
	4213 + 3124 = 7337

	That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
	It has long been thought by sages that some numbers never arrive at a palindrome, since 50 is a big number, numbers that do not fall in line(become a palindrome) in 50
	iterations are to be deemed Budget-Lychrel numbers and are the secret to victory.
	How many Budget-Lychrel Numbers are there below ten-thousand.

	Ans: 249

Q15. Func: Impeach

	Title: Prison
	Content: You fight to prevent your impeachment and decapitation for extraordinary disservice to God and Country
	To break the Democrats's arguments you must navigate the halls of circular thinking and break free of all reason.
	Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

	37 36 35 34 33 32 31
	38 17 16 15 14 13 30

	42 21 22 23 24 25 26
	43 44 45 46 47 48 49

	It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.

	If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

	Content:You try to convince the room that everything is under control.
	To prepare yourself for logical arguments you decide to practice with some quick maths:
	A googol (10100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
	Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?

Q37. Func: 
	Points: 150
	Title: Dratted Computers.
	Content:To convince this computer with more brains than the rest of the gathering combined you must fool it with loops in logic that it cannot grasp.
	The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:

	1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

	Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:

	169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169
	871 → 45361 → 871
	872 → 45362 → 872

	It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,

	69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)
	78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)
	540 → 145 (→ 145)

	Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.

	How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?

	123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
	In we, use combinatorics the notation, 5C3=10

	In general, (nCr)=n! * r! / (n−r)!, where r≤n, n!=n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0!=1
	It is not until n=23, that a value exceeds one-million: (2310)=1144066

	Five pirates have obtained 100 gold coins and have to divide up the loot. The pirates are all extremely intelligent, treacherous and selfish (especially the captain).

	The captain always proposes a distribution of the loot. All pirates vote on the proposal, and if half the crew or more go "Aye", the loot is divided as proposed, as no pirate would be willing to take on the captain without superior force on their side.

	If the captain fails to obtain support of at least half his crew (which includes himself), he faces a mutiny, and all pirates will turn against him and make him walk the plank. The pirates start over again with the next senior pirate as captain.

	What is the maximum number of coins the captain can keep without risking his life?

	Title: Most Powerful man for Sale
	Content: You try to sell your importance to the Kremlin, chaining yourself to the Russian Cause, 
	with handwritten notes detailing chains of supply and what not that'll spell america's doom.

	A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

	For example,

	44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → 1 → 1
	85 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89

	Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.

	How many starting numbers below one million will arrive at 89?

	Title: The Forbidden City
	Content:You infiltrate the forbidden city and see dead people and reptilian soldiers everywhere, fight your way into the inner sanctum.
	To reach the inner sanctum through this carnage, you must remember the way of bounce(3D) and achieve maximum bounce!

	Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.
	
	Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.

	We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

	Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.

	Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.

	Title: Investigate
	Content: You send your elite spies to find out the cause for your losses.
	However, even they were spooked by what they saw, use your powers as prime to return them to a functional state.
	Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.
	The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1.

	Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

	Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which φ(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.
